# React Shopping Cart
React app made with vite+react+typescript. I build it just to test the Vite engine, Typescript syntax and some react concepts.


The design is not that good because I wasn't very focused on the design for this. Just wanted to explore Typescript syntax a bit and have a better understanding of concepts like useState, use Context, react custom hooks, react routing and react code spliting.


This is the first react app that I ship on Github and hopefully the first of a long list of better and better react apps
